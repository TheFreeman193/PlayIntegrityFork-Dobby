# Play Integrity Fork

### The [osm0sis fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork) has switched to using Dobby for hooking. This fork is no longer needed.

*PIF forked to be more futureproof and develop more methodically*

A Zygisk module which fixes "ctsProfileMatch" (SafetyNet) and "MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY" (Play Integrity).

To use this module you must have one of the following:

- Magisk with Zygisk enabled.
- KernelSU with [ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) module installed.

## About module

It injects a classes.dex file to modify a few fields in the android.os.Build class. Also, it creates a hook in the native code to modify system properties. These are spoofed only to Google Play Services' DroidGuard (SafetyNet/Play Integrity) service.

The purpose of the module is to avoid hardware attestation.

## About 'custom.pif.json' file

You can fill out the included template [example.pif.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/main/module/example.pif.json) from the module directory then rename it to custom.pif.json to spoof custom values to the GMS unstable process. It will be used instead of any included pif.json.

You can't use values from recent devices due them triggering full hardware backed attestation.

Older formatted custom.pif.json files from cross-forks and previous releases will be automatically migrated to the latest format.

A migration may also be performed manually with `sh migrate.sh` and custom.pif.json in the same directory, or from a file explorer app that supports script execution.

## Troubleshooting

### Failing BASIC verdict

If you are failing basicIntegrity (SafetyNet) or MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY (Play Integrity) something is wrong in your setup. Recommended steps in order to find the problem:

- Disable all modules except this one

Some modules which modify system can trigger DroidGuard detection, never hook GMS processes.

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on KernelSU)

- Disable ZygiskNext
- Reboot
- Enable ZygiskNext

### Play Protect/Store Certification and Google Wallet Tap To Pay Setup Security Requirements

Follow these steps:

- Flash the module in Magisk/KernelSU
- Clear Google Wallet cache (if you have it)
- Clear Google Play Store cache and data
- Clear Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) cache and data (Optionally skip clearing data and wait some time, ~24h, for it to resolve on its own)
- Reboot

Note clearing Google Play Services app ***data*** will then require you to reset any WearOS devices paired to your device.

### Read module logs

You can read module logs using this command directly after boot:

```
adb shell "logcat | grep 'PIF/'"
```

Add "VERBOSE_LOGS" with a value of "0", "1", "2", "3" or "100" as the last entry of your custom.pif.json to enable higher logging levels; "100" will dump all the system properties that DroidGuard is checking.

## Can this module pass MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY?

No.
